- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works across all platforms supported by SDL, including Windows, Linux, and macOS
- **Pre-Built Native Libraries**: The package includes pre-built native libraries, so you don't need to worry about installing SDL separately
- **Multi-Target Support**: Compatible with .NET 6, .NET 7, .NET 8, .NET 9, .NET 10, .NET Standard 2.0, and .NET Standard 2.1
