	/// Pressure-sensitive pen proximity event structure (event.pproximity.*)<br/>
	/// When a pen becomes visible to the system (it is close enough to a tablet,<br/>
	/// etc), SDL will send an SDL_EVENT_PEN_PROXIMITY_IN event with the new pen's<br/>
	/// ID. This ID is valid until the pen leaves proximity again (has been removed<br/>
	/// from the tablet's area, the tablet has been unplugged, etc). If the same<br/>
	/// pen reenters proximity again, it will be given a new ID.<br/>
	/// Note that "proximity" means "close enough for the tablet to know the tool<br/>
	/// is there." The pen touching and lifting off from the tablet while not<br/>
	/// leaving the area are handled by SDL_EVENT_PEN_DOWN and SDL_EVENT_PEN_UP.<br/>
	/// Not all platforms have a window associated with the pen during proximity<br/>
	/// events. Some wait until motion/button/etc events to offer this info.<br/>
