	/// some indexed formats, instead multiple pixels are packed into each byte),<br/>
	/// and a byte order given by the format. After encoding all pixels, any<br/>
	/// remaining bytes to reach the pitch are used as padding to reach a desired<br/>
	/// alignment, and have undefined contents.<br/>
	/// When a surface holds YUV format data, the planes are assumed to be<br/>
	/// contiguous without padding between them, e.g. a 32x32 surface in NV12<br/>
	/// format with a pitch of 32 would consist of 32x32 bytes of Y plane followed<br/>
	/// by 32x16 bytes of UV plane.<br/>
	/// When a surface holds MJPG format data, pixels points at the compressed JPEG<br/>
	/// image and pitch is the length of that data.<br/>
