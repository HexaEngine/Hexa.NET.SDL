	/// <summary>
	/// A type representing an atomic integer value.<br/>
	/// This can be used to manage a value that is synchronized across multiple<br/>
	/// CPUs without a race condition; when an app sets a value with SDL_AtomicSet<br/>
	/// all other threads, regardless of the CPU it is running on, will see that<br/>
	/// value when retrieved with SDL_AtomicGet, regardless of CPU caches, etc.<br/>
	/// This is also useful for atomic compare-and-swap operations: a thread can<br/>
	/// change the value as long as its current value matches expectations. When<br/>
	/// done in a loop, one can guarantee data consistency across threads without a<br/>
	/// lock (but the usual warnings apply: if you don't know what you're doing, or<br/>
	/// you don't do it carefully, you can confidently cause any number of<br/>
	/// disasters with this, so in most cases, you _should_ use a mutex instead of<br/>
	/// this!).<br/>
	/// This is a struct so people don't accidentally use numeric operations on it<br/>
	/// directly. You have to use SDL_Atomic* functions.<br/>
